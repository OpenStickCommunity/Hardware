Description - This is a remix of the Open Stick case to support a Prusa XL build plate.

You will need a build plate of at least 360mm wide by 210mm long.

For the frame, I would suggest adding supports for the back wall buttons and the Neutrik port.

You will also need 12 M4-6 heat inserts and 4 M3-4 heat inserts. The frame takes 8 M4 inserts, and the top panel takes 4 M4 inserts and 4 M3 inserts.

For the hardware, I used 8 M4x8 screws for the top and bottom panel to the frame. The joystick you will need 4 M4x6 screws to bottom mount it.

Finally, the board you will need 4 M3x6 screws. Please see the pictures for reference.
