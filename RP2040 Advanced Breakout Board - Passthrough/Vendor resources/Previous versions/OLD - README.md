## Summary

The vendor resources section contains files that vendors may find useful to help them make, package and sell the RP2040 Advanced Breakout Board.

The GP2040-CE team heavily recommends that you include a printout of the `GP2040-CE Info Card` as it contains a basic overview of the board shortcuts, a link to the GP2040-CE website and a pinout of the board.

- This has been formatted so that it will print on normal 4x6 thermal stickers (which I presume most vendors will have).

There is also an included `GP2040-CE - Quick Refernce Card` which includes the default GP2040-CE shortcuts, LED hotkeys and a table of the button mappings.

- This has been sized at 80mm x 51mm to fit within the safe area of most business card printing providers, and a batch from Moo UK has been tested successfully. It can also be scaled up as needed due to the high resolution of the PDF.  

Vendors are responsible for supporting their own devices.  Support requests that come into the main GitHub or Discord will be directed back at the vendor who sold the product.
