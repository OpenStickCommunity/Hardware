## Summary

This is a simple plate cover for the Sanwa JLF.  It will not work properly on a JLX or JLX2.

Why do we need a plate cover?  I'm working on my personal AFS build and it has a windowed bottom and figured it would be neat to cover the plate on my JLF.

Not much more to them!  There is a lip to cover the 1.6mm edge so print them face down.

I have tested these on my X1C in PLA and they fit just fine.  They should slide on with friction.  You may have different expereinces with your printer and filament.
