## Summary

These are files for cutting foam that will fit the bottom of Haute42 : COSMOX units.

## Cutting Process

Each of these have been tested on my Cricut Maker 3 and fit on their respective unit.

These have also been tested on a Glowforge by someone else and work as well.

It is recommended to use adhesive back foam for these.

NOTE 1 - The new M+ Series is larger than most A4 sized foam sheets.  I have made a slightly smaller cut that will fit an A4 sheet.
NOTE 2 - There is an older version of the Mini that does not have a passthrough USB port on it.  

All source files were made in Affinity Designer 2 based off of reference files that were provided to me directly by Haute42 : COSMOX.  The source files for Affinity Designer 2 can be found in the [Source](Source%20Files/) folder.  The files provided by Haute42 : COSMOX are not available.
