Flatbox Rev 5 RGB - Art Case
---

Summary: 

The Flatbox Rev 5 RGB Art Case is a more premium case that allows for a plexi top cover and option art insert.  

The top plexi is a .DXF file which should be usable by most places that can cut plexi.  It is recommended to do this part in 1-2mm plexi.

Please note that printing the buttons in white resin will allow the LEDs to show through better, but there are no issues with printing them in PLA with a normal 3D printer.
