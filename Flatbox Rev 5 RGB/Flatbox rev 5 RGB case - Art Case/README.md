Flatbox Rev 5 RGB - Art Case
---

Summary: 

The Flatbox Rev 5 RGB Art Case is a more premium case that allows for a plexi top cover and optional art insert.  

The top plexi is a .DXF file which should be usable by most places that can cut plexi.  It is recommended to do this part in 1-2mm plexi.

Please note that printing the buttons in white resin will allow the LEDs to show through better, but there are no issues with printing them in PLA with a normal 3D printer.

Please also note that this stock shot is from the previous version of the board that only had one LED per button.  The current version uses two LEDs per button.
