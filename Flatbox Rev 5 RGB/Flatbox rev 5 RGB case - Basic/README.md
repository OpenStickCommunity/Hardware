Flatbox Rev 5 RGB - Basic Case
---

Summary: 

The Flatbox Rev 5 RGB Basic Case is a simple case that omits the flexible auxillary button tabs in favor of button caps.  While I have not come up with a perfect solution yet for diffusing the Player LEDs, it looks quite good if you put two layers of painters tape on the front of the top case and then a flat metal object and inject some hot glue from the other side.
