# Definition of "NonCommercial"

For the purposes of all hardware submitted to this repository, the definition of NonCommercial is “in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.”. 

NonCommercial designs may be "sold" in a "group buy" to help individuals lower costs under the following conditions:
- There is a single organizer of the "group buy" who does not represent a commercial entity
- The "group buy" is not facilitated on a website through any cart-based mechanism
- The costs of the "group buy" (including all shipping fees) are shared with the group before the PCBs are manufactured
- The PCBs are not sold for profit. Profit is defined as any additional money over actual costs. "Donations" and/or "tips" are considered profit under this definition.

In order to adhere to the rules of the "group buy" exception, group buys should account for (and split equally) the cost of additional PCBs needed to account for manufacturing defects. The amount of extra PCBs ordered to account for defects must be shared with, and agreed to, by the entire group. The group is free to decide amongst themselves how to distribute the "extra" PCBs, they cannot be resold for profit.
