## Summary

The vendor resources section contains files that vendors may find useful to help them make, package and sell the Open_Core0.

The GP2040-CE team heavily recommends that you include a printout of the `GP2040-CE Info Card - Open_Core0 WASD.pdf` as it contains a basic overview of the board shortcuts, a link to the GP2040-CE website and a pinout of the board.  It can be found [HERE](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/blob/main/Open_Core0%20WASD/Vendor%20resources/GP2040-CE%20info%20card%20-%20Open_Core0%20WASD.pdf)

- This has been formatted so that it will print on normal 4x6 thermal stickers (which I presume most vendors will have).
