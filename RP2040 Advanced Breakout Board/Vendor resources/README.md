## Summary

The vendor resources section contains files that vendors may find useful to help them make, package and sell the RP2040 Advanced Breakout Board.

The GP2040-CE team heavily recommends that you include a printout of the `GP2040-CE Info Card` as it contains a basic overview of the board shortcuts, a link to the GP2040-CE website and a pinout of the board.

- This has been formatted so that it will print on normal 4x6 thermal stickers (which I presume most vendors will have).

There is also an included `GP2040-CE - Quick Refernce Card` which includes the default GP2040-CE shortcuts, LED hotkeys and a table of the button mappings.

- This has been sized at 80mm x 51mm to fit within the safe area of most business card printing providers, and a batch from Moo UK has been tested successfully. It can also be scaled up as needed due to the high resolution of the PDF.
