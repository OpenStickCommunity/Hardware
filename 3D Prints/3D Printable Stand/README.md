## Summary

These are two 3D Printable Stands in small (and large), but well balanaced, designs for holding sticks like the Open_Core0, Flatbox and other small (and large) board designs. 


### Printing tips

Here are my printing specs
Printer: Bambu Lab X1C
Nozzle: 0.2mm steel
Sheet: Textured PEI
Filament: Bambu Lab Matte Black PLA
Layer height: 0.1mm
Outter walls: 6
Infill percentage: 15%
Infill type: Honeycomb

If printing on a larger nozzle like the 0.4mm you can do 3 outter walls.


## Sales recommendations

These should be included at little to no cost with existing orders.

You are free to set your own price as you see fit. 


## Donations

Donations are not necessary but always welcome!  All received donations will be used to try out new designs or send things to people for testing, iterations and helping people get board setups that might not be in an economic position to get one themselves.
