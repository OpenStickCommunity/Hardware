## Warnings / Disclaimer:

Please note the following warnings / disclaimer:
- This is designed specificially for the Sanwa JLF lever.  It will not work with other levers.  It should work with the JLX but has not been tested.
- I am not responcible for prints that fail or do not turn out as intended.
- I am not responcible for any damage that happens to your printer or parts of your printer as a result of printing these files.

## Summary:

The goal of this project was to create a high quality fightstick case that could be printed on a 250mm x 250mm print bed in parts.  The Open Stick Modular (OSM) is a continuation of the original Open Stick Case design to allow for greater flexibility and customization of individual parts while reducing the chances of print failures on the main frame.

## Printing and Construction:

This project is now complete and I have printed and checked the final version of each file.  If there are improvements made and those files will be posted when I make them.

Please note that I am not taking on requests for other layouts at this time.  The STLs and STEP files have been posted so you can be easily edited in TinkerCAD or Fusion360 (or the program of your choice).

This case was printed on a Bambu Labs X1C and P1S printer with the following changes to settings:
- 3 outer walls (Bambu Lab - 3 Wall loops)
- Hex infill
- 15% infill

Please note that only one part needs supports printed, the `OSM - Front Middle Bracket`.  All other parts can be printed without supports.

Based on my prints the entire case takes around 950 grams of filament so you should be able to easily get a case out of a single 1kg roll.

This case was printed using Bambu Labs matte, normal and marble PLA filament.

Each piece should be placed flat down on the print bed to ensure maximum strength. 

Each of the corner pieces should be oriented on their outside facing large surface flat down and printed at the lowest possible layer height to ensure a good quality print.

The following hardware is needed to assemble the case:
- 8 x M4 35mm brass standoffs
- 44 x M4 14mm countersunk hex bolts
- 28 x M4 flange nuts (or 20 x M4 acorn nuts)
- 4 x M3 8mm button top hex bolts
- 2 x M3 18mm countersunk hex bolts
- 2 x M3 nuts


Assembly:
- The M4 35mm brass standoffs slide into the four corner posts as well as mid-beams and should be friction fit.
- Each mid-frame section is assembled with four M4 14mm countersunk bolts secured with either a flange or acorn nut.
- The JLF lever is secured with four M4 14mm countersunk bolts secured with either flange or acorn nuts.
- The top and bottom plates are secured with four (each) M4 14mm countersunk bolts.
- The Neutrik port is secured with two M3 18mm countersunk hex bolts and two M3 nuts.

Please note that if you are planning on using acorn nuts for the JLF lever it is recommended to use the included [Support Brackets](3D%20Print%20Files/OSM%20-%20Back%20JLF%20Support%20Bracket.stl).
