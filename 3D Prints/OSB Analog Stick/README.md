## Summary

The OSB Analog Stick is a 30mm drop in Analog Stick for fightsticks.

While the board can accept both the standard module and the module with a button in it, it is recommended to use the version without the button.

These modules are not the best, as such this should only be used for light analog navigation or non-precision use.

## Board design choices

There is a simple PCB with the OSB Analog Stick.

There is only one way to connect to this board:
- ZH 1.50mm 5 pin vertical SMD

---

## Assembly

Assembly is quite straight forward on this board.  All that is needed is to solder the hot swap socket on and, if you choose, the 2.4mm or PH2.00mm 2pin connector(s)

Parts necessary for assembly of the PCBs:

1 x PCB<br/>
1 x Analog Joystick [choose the item name 'black' with vertical pins] (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007402376562.html)<br/>
4 x M2 5mm Hex Hexagon Socket Cap Head Self Tapping Screws (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000350027047.html)<br/>
1 x ZH 1.50mm 5 pin vertical SMD (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008884434710.html)<br/>

Parts necessary for assembly of 3D printed button:

1 x OSB Analog Stick Cap<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Ring<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Insert<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Body<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Nut<br/>

## How to print the OSB Analog Stick:

A .3MF file is included which can be loaded into most slicers with a set of my recommended settings.  

To make each analog stick you will need:
1 x OSB Analog Stick Cap<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Ring<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Insert<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Body<br/>
1 x OSB Analog Stick Nut<br/>

The rim should be printed flat side down.  The nut should also be printed flat side down.  

There are no supports needed for this print.  

It is recommended to print at the lowest print layer height your printer can do.  

I have extensivly printed and tested these on my BambuLabs X1C and P1S using both a 0.4mm and 0.2mm nozzle on normal and matte PLA.  

The recommended print setting are to do 4-6 wall loops and then enough top and bottom laters to have solid infill.  

You may need to adjust to achieve a good print on your own printer.  

!!!Please note - I am not responcible for missprints or any costs incured from missprints!!!
