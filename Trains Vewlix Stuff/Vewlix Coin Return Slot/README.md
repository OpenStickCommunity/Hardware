## Summary

This is a collection of different Vewlix / Chewlix Coin Return Slots.  

There are three different versions included here:</br>
1 - `Vewlix Coin Return Slot - Original` - Copy of the original design.</br>
2 - `Vewlix Coin Return Slot - Extended` - Extended version of the original with a sloped back, good if you want to have a bunch of coins in there at any given moment.</br>
3 - `Vewlix Coin Return Slot - Push in flap` - Extended and has a push in flap so coins are easier to get. The flap on this one will not swing forward like in the others.</br>


## Printing tips

Print multiple outside walls as well as multiple top and bottom layers so that this prints at 100% infill.  It is a very small part but prints quickly and will be strong.  

I printed this originally on my Bambu X1C with matte black PLA.

I have also had this done from JLCPCB in their `Imagine Black` resin and it turned out very well.
