## Summary

These are .STL files for making a small case that can be used with the RP2040 Mini Breakout Board.  

I have printed many of these cases on a Bambu Lab X1C and P1P with default settings.  

There is no need for supports with this print.  

If printing a case, you will also need the following parts:
4 x M2 4mm brass standoffs (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003106030065.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.39.a21718023M6vl0)
8 x M2 4mm countersunk hex bolts (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32968097507.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.25.a21718023M6vl0)

While I have not tested these prints out through JLCs print server, there should be no issues having them done in the following materials:
- PA12 nylon
- 9000R resin
- Black resin

I would avoid the following materials from JLC:
- Imagine black resin
