## Summary

The SEGA Dreamcast Twin Stick Drop-in Replacement Board is intended as a reversible solution that enables compatibility with modern hardware without permanently modifying any of the controller's components.

Because of this, no additional buttons are added to the controller with this board. By default (after loading the settings file provided through the GP2040-CE Web Configurator, the A2 button ('home' on most systems) is activated using a macro of the START and PAUSE buttons together.

Outside of the main PCB and the RP2040-Zero board, a list of the individual components needed for this project is provided in the Bill of Materials.

## Sales recommendations
