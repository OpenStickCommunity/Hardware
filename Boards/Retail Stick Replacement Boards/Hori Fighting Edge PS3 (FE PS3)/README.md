## Summary

The Hori Fighting Edge PS3 (FE PS3) Drop-in Replacement Board is designed to be a quick and easy drop-in solution for the Hori Fighting Edge PS3.

Please note that this will only work on the PS3 version of the Hori Fighting Edge and not the Xbox 360 one.  This is further confusing because the image shown has both PS3 and Xbox on it.  That was a failed attempt at a dual board but it did not end up working on the Xbox 360 version so I removed it from the PCB layout.

Reading this and have a Hori Fighting Edge Xbox 360 that you want to donate to the cause?  I would be happy to get it and continue the work on the dual board!

Please also note that there is no set configuration for this board and you may need to configure on your own until I post a dedicated configuration for it.  Until then please reference the source files for the pinout of the RP2040.

Given that I do not consider this board finished, please proceed at your own risk!  I will not answer any questions about ordering the boards or setup, and no support will be offered on it.  If you do not know how to order a board from JLCPCB with assembly this might not be for you.

A STEP model is available [HERE](3D%20Files/STEP%20-%20Hori%20Fighitng%20Edge%20PS3%20(FE%20PS3).step) although it is not really needed since this board directly replaces the original board.

I also have some drop in RGB LED replacement boards for the four side LEDs.  These will be updated at a later time because they are very complicated to make and cannot be economically assembled by JLCPCB (aka you will need to solder them by hand).


## Sales recommendations

It is not recommended to sell this board as it is not completed yet and should only be used for hobby purposes.


## Donations

Donations are not necessary but always welcome!  I typically use donations to try out new designs or send boards to people for testing, iterations and helping people get board setups that might not be in an economic position to get one themselves.
