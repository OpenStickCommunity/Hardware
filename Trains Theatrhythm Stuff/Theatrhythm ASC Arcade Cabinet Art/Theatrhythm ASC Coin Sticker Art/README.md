## Summary

This was my attempt to make the Theatrhythm ASC coin sticker art.  

It was done by overlaying images found both on the internet and taken for me by community members.

I made these in Affinity Designer and have included my working files in the source folder.

I have also included high resoltuion .PNG files in the assets folder.

Everything has been done as vector files so you should be able to make any size adjustments you need to the source files as needed.

You may need a font for this, if you do it is in the source folder under a sub-folder called `Fonts`.
