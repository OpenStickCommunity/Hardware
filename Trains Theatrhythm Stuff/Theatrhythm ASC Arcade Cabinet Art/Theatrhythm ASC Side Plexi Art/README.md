## Summary

This was my attempt to make the repeating pattern found on the Theatrhythm ASC arcade machines side plexi.  

It was done by overlaying images found both on the internet and taken for me by community members.

I made these in Affinity Designer and have included my working files in the source folder.

I have also included high resoltuion .PNG files in the assets folder.

The pattern example is very large, so a smaller resolution version of that is also included.

The pattern is not wrapping, so if you need to make a larger example you will need to use the two included panel tiles.

Everything has been done as vector files so you should be able to make any size adjustments you need to the source files as needed.
