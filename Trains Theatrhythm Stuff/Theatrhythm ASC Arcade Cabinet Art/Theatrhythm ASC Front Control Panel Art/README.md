## Summary

This was my attempt to make the art found on the front of the Theatrhythm ASC arcade machines side plexi.  

It was done by overlaying images found both on the internet and taken for me by community members.

I made these in Affinity Designer and have included my working files in the source folder.

Everything has been done as vector files so you should be able to make any size adjustments you need to the source files as needed.
